### About Us

Who We Are

Open Psychological Science Nigeria (OPSN) is a community-driven initiative committed to advancing transparent, reproducible, and accessible psychological science in Nigeria. We aim to foster a research culture that values openness, methodological rigor, ethical responsibility, and global collaboration.

OPSN brings together students, early-career researchers, clinicians, and senior academics who are interested in improving the credibility, visibility, and societal impact of psychological research conducted in Nigeria and across Africa.

### Why Open Science in Nigeria?

Psychological science globally is undergoing a transformation in response to concerns about reproducibility, transparency, and public trust. In Nigeria, these challenges are compounded by structural constraints such as limited research funding, restricted access to journals, and uneven methodological training.

Open science practices—such as preregistration, open data, open materials, and open access publishing—offer powerful tools to:

- Improve research credibility and reproducibility

- Enhance collaboration across institutions and countries

- Increase the global visibility of Nigerian scholarship

- Promote ethical and responsible research practices

- Democratize the production of and access to scientific knowledge

OPSN exists to support Nigerian researchers in engaging with these practices in ways that are context-sensitive, inclusive, and sustainable.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to promote and institutionalize open science practices within psychological research, training, and application in Nigeria.

We seek to:

- Build capacity for open and reproducible research

- Support early-career researchers and students

- Encourage ethical, transparent research practices

### Activities

OPSN engages in activities including:

- Workshops and training on open science tools and practices

- Public talks and seminars on transparency, ethics, and reproducibility

- Resource curation (guides, templates, and learning materials)

- Community building for students and early-career researchers

- Collaborations with local and international research groups
